Expectations:

Your HTML/CSS/JavaScript will need to present the menu and retrive the patron's selection and return an invoiced reciept to the user's screen with their total purchase price once they press an "Order" button.

The client is not particular about the aesthetics and images are not required. Therefore, you have full freedom on the front end design. However, they are sticklers about menu functionality.


Solution:

* See pizza.js in js folder
* Set up the UI
* Form has all the items from the requirements
* Form will not submit until all the radio buttons are selected
* Submitted form will call an eventListner that initializes, calculates and displays receipt
* Receipt section shows up
* Receipt can be cancelled
* See notes from the script
